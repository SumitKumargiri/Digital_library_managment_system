A Digital Library Management System is a web application designed to manage and organize digital resources, such as e-books, documents, videos, and other multimedia content, in a user-friendly manner. This system allows users to search, browse, and access digital content easily. Here's a basic overview of how you could create a simple Digital Library Management System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP:

Front-End (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):

HTML: Create the structure of your web pages. This includes pages for displaying the library catalog, search results, individual resource details, and user authentication.
CSS: Style your web pages to make them visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: Add interactivity to your web pages. For example, you can implement dynamic search functionality, AJAX for loading content without page refreshes, and user interface elements like modals and dropdowns.
Back-End (PHP):

Server-Side Logic: Implement the server-side logic using PHP. This includes handling user authentication, interacting with the database, and processing search requests.
Database: Set up a database to store information about digital resources. You can use a relational database like MySQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
